The project included little from outside libraries compared to many of the
things that other static web pages typically include. However, we did include
and borrow from outside sources. They are listed here.

Password gauge based on:
http://bernii.github.io/gauge.js/
This was used so that the user could see how strong their password was in an easy and clear format. Although the gauge was used from
an outside source, all of the rules and suggestions were created by our team.

Password Criteria:
From their respective websites
This was used to check the user's password against common companies and their password criteria.

Common and Exposed Passwords:
https://www.geeknoob.com/1000-most-common-passwords.html and
https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords
This was used to check the user's password against the top 1000 most common passwords and a database of cracked passwords.

SHA1 Javascript implementation:
http://coursesweb.net/javascript/sha1-encrypt-data_cs
This was used to encrypt the user's password before sending it to haveibeenpwned.com.

Also used:

This was used to shuffle arrays to get a random password generator.

Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) and as a consequence
